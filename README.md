# Sports Concussion Assessment System
# About The Project

The Sports Concussion Assessment System is a console application designed to assist sports medical practitioners in monitoring and evaluating athletes for potential concussion symptoms following games or training sessions. The system serves two main user groups: athletes and sports medical practitioners. Athletes use the app to input their health conditions and pain levels, and the system compares these symptoms with previous entries to identify any changes. The app stores data for the five most recent games, allowing athletes to review a summary of their symptoms for each game. This information helps sports medical practitioners make informed decisions and provide appropriate advice to athletes.
