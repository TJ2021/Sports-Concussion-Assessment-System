# Sports Concussion Assessment System
## About The Project

The Sports Concussion Assessment System is a console application designed to assist sports medical practitioners in monitoring and evaluating athletes for potential concussion symptoms following games or training sessions. The system serves two main user groups: athletes and sports medical practitioners. Athletes use the app to input their health conditions and pain levels, and the system compares these symptoms with previous entries to identify any changes. The app stores data for the five most recent games, allowing athletes to review a summary of their symptoms for each game. This information helps sports medical practitioners make informed decisions and provide appropriate advice to athletes.

## Lessons Learned
- Elicit software system requirements through user scenarios and diagrams.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Gathered requirements by creating user scenarios and diagrams to ensure the system met user needs.
- Identify and define objects from provided scenarios.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Broke down scenarios into objects with specific attributes and behaviors, forming the foundation of the system's architecture.
- Develop comprehensive class diagrams for identified objects.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Created detailed class diagrams for the identified objects, defining their relationships and interactions.
- Apply UML notation to create accurate class and use case diagrams.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Used UML notation to create clear and accurate class and use case diagrams for the system's design.
- Implement a functional application using Java.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Built the application using Java, focusing on writing efficient and maintainable code that met the projectâ€™s requirements.
